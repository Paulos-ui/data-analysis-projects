## Project Overview
This repository contains my data analysis projects using **Advanced Excel** techniques such as **data cleaning, pivot tables, sorting, formulas, and more**. The goal is to showcase my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights through various Excel functions and tools.

##  Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates, handling missing values, formatting data  
- **Pivot Tables:** Summarizing and analyzing large datasets efficiently  
- **Sorting & Filtering:** Organizing data for better insights  
- **Excel Formulas:** Using `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP`, `IF`, `INDEX-MATCH`, `TEXT`, and more  
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlighting key trends in data  
- **Charts & Visualizations:** Creating bar charts, pie charts, and trend analysis  

##  Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project includes:
- **Sales Data:** Monthly sales records with product details  
- **Customer Insights:** Customer demographics and purchase history  
- **Financial Data:** Revenue and expense tracking  

##  Key Findings
- Identified top-performing products based on sales trends  
- Segmented customers based on purchase behavior  
- Improved data accuracy by cleaning inconsistencies  

## How to Use
1. Download the `project-summary.xlsx` file  
2. Open in **Microsoft Excel** (2016 or later recommended)  
3. Navigate through the sheets:
   - **Raw Data:** Contains unprocessed information  
   - **Cleaned Data:** Organized dataset after applying transformations  
   - **Pivot Tables & Charts:** Visual insights from analysis  

##  Future Improvements
